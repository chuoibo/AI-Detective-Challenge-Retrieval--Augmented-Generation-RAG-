The stolen cryptocurrency was quickly moved through Tornado Cash, a decentralized mixer used to obscure the origin of funds. Tornado Cash allows users to send tokens into a smart contract, which then redistributes the funds to new addresses, making it difficult to trace the original transaction.

The exchangeâ€™s security team noticed that within 30 minutes of the initial theft, the funds were funneled into multiple Tornado Cash transactions. Each transaction was structured to ensure maximum anonymity.

Authorities suspect that the hacker intended to cash out through peer-to-peer trading platforms. Blockchain analysis identified at least five intermediary wallets that received the laundered funds before they were withdrawn via an unknown exchange.
