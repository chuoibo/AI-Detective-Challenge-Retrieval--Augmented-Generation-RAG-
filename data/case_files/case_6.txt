In an earlier security incident unrelated to the current investigation, a group of hackers attempted to gain access to the exchangeâ€™s database through a SQL injection attack. The attempt was detected and blocked before any data was compromised.

The attackers had used outdated exploits targeting vulnerabilities that had already been patched. Security logs indicate that the attack originated from servers in Eastern Europe.

This case has no connection to the stolen cryptocurrency funds but serves as a reminder of ongoing cybersecurity threats faced by financial institutions.
