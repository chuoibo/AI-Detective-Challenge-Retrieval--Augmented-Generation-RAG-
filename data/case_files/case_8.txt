A minor security breach occurred two weeks before the crypto exchange hack. An unauthorized third party accessed an internal database containing non-sensitive customer metadata.

The breach was quickly detected, and the database was secured within hours. No financial data or login credentials were compromised.

While the incident raised concerns, security analysts determined that it had no direct connection to the recent cryptocurrency theft.
