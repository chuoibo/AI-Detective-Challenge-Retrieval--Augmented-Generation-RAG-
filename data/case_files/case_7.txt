A ransom note demanding Bitcoin was sent to the exchangeâ€™s customer support team shortly after the attack. The message threatened to release sensitive customer data unless the ransom was paid within 48 hours.

The hacker included a small sample of leaked customer information as proof of the breach. The email was sent from a temporary, encrypted email service commonly used by cybercriminals.

Investigators suspect that the ransom demand was either a diversionary tactic or an additional extortion attempt. The exchange did not comply with the ransom demand, and security teams worked to mitigate any potential data leaks.
