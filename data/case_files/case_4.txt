A cybersecurity firm reported an increase in malware infections targeting corporate devices. The malware was designed to capture keystrokes and send them to remote servers.

Investigators found evidence that some of the malware-infected devices belonged to financial institutions. However, there is no direct link between this malware and the stolen cryptocurrency funds.

Experts believe the malware campaign was orchestrated by a well-known hacker group, but its primary targets were banking institutions rather than crypto exchanges.
